-- TODO write state back to config file (on program exit or on each value change)
-- TODO find and handle every operation that can fail
-- TODO handle the case where the target file value and config value dont match, for instance on startup

-- TODO handle the case where targetValue is not an element of possibleValues
-- TODO refactor StateTransitions
-- TODO add module documentation
-- TODO add README (known issues, termCap)

-- domain concepts  line(?) selection, value selection, old file content, new file content
-- mode = LineSelection | ValueSelection
-- LineSelection = NextLine | PreviousLine
-- ValueSelection = NextValue | PreviousValue
-- <DomainFunction> :: mode -> OldFile -> NewFile
-- ModificationCommand
-- Line may be a rendering concept, rather than a domain concept -> item could already be better
